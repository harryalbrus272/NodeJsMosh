Two approaches in modelling relationships in MongoDB are
1. Using Reference (Normalization) consistency friendly
    let author = {
        name: "Mosh"
    }
    //No relationship between ids passed in the document
    let course = {
        author: 'id',
    }
2. Using Embedded Documents (Denormalization) performance friendly
let course = {
    author: {
        name: 'Mosh'
    }
}
Trade off between query performance vs consistency

//Hybrid
let author = {
    name: 'Mosh'
    //Other properties
}
let course = {
    author: {
        id: 'ref',
        name: 'Mosh'
    }
}
